**Hi! My name is Francisco, but you can call me Chico. :)**

I'm a Brazilian computer scientist passionate about computers and science. I'm involved with software development and machine learning.

I live in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil, and I work with an amazing team at [Luizalabs](https://github.com/luizalabs).

When I'm not working, I like to play [sax](http://soundcloud.com/francisco-de-souza-junior-4188268/) and take photographs (see my [500px](http://500px.com/fsjunior) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fsjunior/) profiles).
